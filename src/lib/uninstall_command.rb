#{colorize :blue, "## DESCRIPTION"}

The 'uninstall' command will remove symlinks in your home folder based on the
contents of the src/ directory. It will iterate over the files there and do one
of a few things depending on what it encounters:

* If it encounters a file, it will remove the corresponding symlink from your
  home directory if it points to this file.
  EXAMPLE: src/tmux.conf removes a symlink at ~/.tmux.conf if the symlink points
  to this file.
* If it encounters a directory, it will recurse the directory and remove
  symlinks inside of your home directory according to the previous rule (with
  the directory renamed so as to begin with a dot).
  EXAMPLE: src/rbenv is iterated over to find src/rbenv/default-gems.
  src/rbenv/default-gems removes a symlink at ~/.rbenv/default-gems if the
  symlink points to this file.

There are some exceptions to this:

* If it encounters a file anywhere that ends in .__no-link__, it will remove the
  corresponding file from your home directory if it has the same content.
  EXAMPLE: src/gitconfig.__no-link__ removes a file at ~/.gitconfig if both
  files are the same.
* If it encounters a directory anywhere that has a .no-recurse file, it will
  NOT recurse the directory; it will remove the symlink for the directory if it
  points to the source directory.
  EXAMPLE: src/zsh, because it contains a .no-recurse file, removes a symlink at
  ~/.zsh.

No files that do not point to or match a corresponding file in src/ will be
removed unless you specify --force.

Finally, if you want to know what this command will do before running it for
real, and especially if this is the first time you're running it, use the
--dry-run option. For further output, use the --verbose option.

#{colorize :blue, "## USAGE"}

#{colorize :bold, "$0 $COMMAND [OPTIONS]"}

where OPTIONS are:

--dry-run, --noop, -n
  Don't actually change the filesystem.
--force, -f
  Usually symlinks that do not point to files in src/ and files that end in
  .__no-link__ that do not match the file they were copied from are not removed.
  This bypasses that.
--verbose, -V
  Show every command that is run when it is run.
--help, -h
  You're looking at it ;)
