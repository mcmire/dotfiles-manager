#{colorize :blue, "## DESCRIPTION"}

The 'install' command will create symlinks in your home folder based on the
contents of the src/ directory. It will iterate over the files there and do one
of a few things depending on what it encounters:

* If it encounters a file, it will create a symlink in your home folder that
  points to this file (with the file renamed so as to begin with a dot).
  EXAMPLE: src/tmux.conf creates a symlink at ~/.tmux.conf.
* If it encounters a directory, it will recurse the directory and create
  symlinks inside of your home directory according to the previous rule (with
  the directory renamed so as to begin with a dot).
  EXAMPLE: src/rbenv is iterated over to find src/rbenv/default-gems.
  src/rbenv/default-gems then creates a symlink at ~/.rbenv/default-gems.

There are some exceptions to this:

* If it encounters a file anywhere called __install__.sh, it will treat that
  file as an executable and run it. (It assumes you have chmod'd this file
  correctly and that this script has a shebang.)
* If it encounters a file anywhere that ends in .__no-link__, it will copy this
  file to your home directory instead of creating a symlink.
  EXAMPLE: src/gitconfig.__no-link__ creates a file (not a symlink) at
  ~/.gitconfig.
* If it encounters a directory anywhere that has a .no-recurse file, it will
  NOT recurse the directory; instead, it will create a symlink for the
  directory.
  EXAMPLE: src/zsh, because it contains a .no-recurse file, creates a symlink at
  ~/.zsh.

No files will be overwritten unless you specify --force.

Finally, if you want to know what this command will do before running it for
real, and especially if this is the first time you're running it, use the
--dry-run option. For further output, use the --verbose option.

#{colorize :bold, "$0 $COMMAND [FIRST_TIME_OPTIONS] [OTHER_OPTIONS]"}

where FIRST_TIME_OPTIONS are one or more of:

--git-name NAME
  The name that you'll use to author Git commits.
--git-email EMAIL
  The email that you'll use to author Git commits.

and OTHER_OPTIONS are one or more of:

--dry-run, --noop, -n
  Don't actually change the filesystem.
--force, -f
  Usually dotfiles that already exist are not overwritten. This bypasses that.
--verbose, -V
  Show every command that is run when it is run.
--help, -h
  You're looking at it ;)
